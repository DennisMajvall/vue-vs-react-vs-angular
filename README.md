This is a comparison between React, Vue and Angular:
A small todo app with identical looks and functionality.

1. Run npm install in each of the three folders.
2. Then npm start in each folder.

The apps will be running on the following ports:
Angular http://localhost:4200/
React http://localhost:3000
Vue http://localhost:8080
